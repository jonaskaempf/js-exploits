# RWX code pages

## v8

v8 has enabled a default flag to enable write-protected code pages:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/f7aa8ea00bbf200e9050a22ec84fab4f323849a7%5E%21/#F0

Does not apply to WASM code pages apparantly. Also default 'false' on ARM and AARCH64.

## SpiderMonkey

SpiderMonkey also employs W^X. Something with shadow W pages?
