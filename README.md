# RWX code pages

## v8

v8 has enabled a default flag to enable write-protected code pages:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/f7aa8ea00bbf200e9050a22ec84fab4f323849a7%5E%21/#F0

Does not apply to WASM code pages (apparantly). Also default set to 'false' on ARM and AARCH64.

The `simple_array_overflow` patch enables RWX code pages. With RWX jit pages we can leak the code page and overwrite the instructions.

## SpiderMonkey

SpiderMonkey also employs W^X. Something with shadow W pages? However the javascript shell does not employ Full RELRO making .got corruption possible.

`spider_simple_array_overflow/pwn.js` demonstrates this.

## ChakraCore

On default Linux build (just running `./build.sh -n`) it appears ChakraCore shell `ch`
builds with RWX stack (and thereby read-implies-execute on all segments).

To get code execution in such a build just requires swapping an entrypoint pointer in
a function object.

## JavaScriptCore
